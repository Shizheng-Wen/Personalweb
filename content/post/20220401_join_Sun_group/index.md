## Overview

I serve as a research assistant advised by [Prof. Hao Sun](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/addons/teacher/index/info.html?user_id=25&ruccode=20210163&ln=en) in Gaoling school of artificial intelligence at Renmin University of China, working on graph neural network (GNN) and partial differential equations (PDEs).

Thanks prof. Sun for giving me this valuable opportunity~ :)
