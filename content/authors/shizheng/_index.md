I have a broad interest in biological/chemical simulation at molecular level. In particular, I am interested in the interaction between biological molecules and water as well as machine learning for multi-scale modeling.  
I am currently a first year graduate student at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/), and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Wanlin Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iw1Rc9gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree from Excellent Class of aircraft Power Engineering at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.  
During my undergraduate period, I was advised by [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&hl=en) at NUAA, working on Nanoscale Heat Transfer. During the summer of 2019, I was visiting [Duke University](https://mems.duke.edu/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) on Machine Learning Assisted Fluid.
