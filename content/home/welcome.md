I strive to develop new methods through the fusion of physical models, data-driven algorithms to understand nature and solve problems in science and engineering. See my [Research page](project). 

I am currently a master student in the department of mathematics, ETH Zurich, majoring in computational science and engineering under the advisement of Prof. [Siddhartha Mishra](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/organisation/who-is-who/math/details.MTY2MzQ3.TGlzdC8xOTA3LDE2NjkxMjU2NTE=.html).

Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree with highest honor (GPA ranking top 1% among 248 students) from Aerospace Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/).

During my undergraduate period, I was advised by [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), working on Nanoscale Heat Transfer. During the summer of 2019, I was visiting Duke University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell). During the period from 2020Fall to 2022Spring, I worked as an independent researcher in the [Insistute of Nano Science (INS)](http://ins.nuaa.edu.cn/) at NUAA, collaborated with distinguished [Prof. Wanlin Guo](http://ins.nuaa.edu.cn/chinese/Members/detail.aspx?id=25). At INS, my research interest is biophysics (Molecular Dynamics).
