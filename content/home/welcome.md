I strive to develop new methods through the fusion of physical models, data-driven algorithms to understand nature and solve problems in science and engineering. See my [Research page](#/project). 

I am currently a research assistant in [INS](http://ins.nuaa.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from Excellent Class of aircraft power engineering at NUAA.

During my undergraduate period, I was advised by [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), working on Nanoscale Heat Transfer. During the summer of 2019, I was visiting Duke University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) (AIAA Honorary Fellow ) on Machine Learning Assisted Fluid.

Originally, I was ready to pursue my PhD degree with full scholarship in University of Minnesota, twin cities. However, my plan was canceled due to the proclamation 10043 signed by Donald Trump.  Now, I am looking for a PhD position in other countries.
